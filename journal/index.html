        <p>In our fast moving world of quick information, we have lost our touch in processing details of art, whether it’s a book, image, or illustration. I agree with the ideas presented in the article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”</a> by Michael Gonchar.</p>

        <p>In websites, there are basic templates businesses and other site owners use for their goals. This does not mean that all websites have to be boring and cookie-cutter-like. This <a href="https://en.manayerbamate.com/">Yerba website</a> does an incredible job of capturing a user’s attention visually. We get a flashy animation of the logo and catchphrase at the start of the site’s loading, and then a finishing visual of fun character’s and the product itself.</p>

        <p>The product is always being displayed as the user explores the website, which reinforces the imagery of the product to the user. Every action the user makes has an animation to go with it, making it more fun to stay engaged with the website’s content.</p>

            <h2>Form Design Best Practices</h2>
            <date>Oct. 22, 2024</date>
        </div>

        <p>Modals, also known as overlays, are great features when you want to simplify the UI and save screen real estate. They are great to use when the goal is to catch the user’s full attention to something else, get user input such as login/sign up forms, or show additional information without losing the context of the parent page.</p>

        <p>In the article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">“Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows“</a> by Naema Baskanderi, we read about the key fundamentals in creating overlays.</p>

        <p>Modal windows must not act like pops and surprise the user though. Modals should appear only due to a user’s action such as a button block or selecting an option. </p>

        <p>Elements to always include in modals are a descriptive title, distinct button labels, and a lightbox effect. Other things to keep in mind are an accessible escape method and the sizing and location of the window. There should always be at least one keyboard accessible control to close the window. A common example would be assigning the escape key to this action. The size of the window should be made to fit its content and be convenient to the user. This means if a scrollbar is needed or if it covers the whole viewport, you shouldn’t be using a modal. This also pertains to why modals should not be used in mobile.</p>

        <p>Now you have the basics in what it takes to make modal windows, go get fancy!</p>

        <p>Although there is more than one way to make great forms, there is still a standard criteria to follow in order to have a high quality form. Forms should be as concise, efficient, and detailed as possible.</p>

        <p>In the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design“</a> by Salim Ansari, he highlights great points of what creates a good form. To make forms concise, we have to minimize the input fields, keep a simple layout, and minimize dropdown menus. This reduces the time it takes for respondents to fill out your form, allowing them to stay relaxed and answer your questions clearly.</p>

        <p>To keep your form efficient for your users, you should break down your form strategically. By separating large fields into multiple steps, it is less of a struggle for your users to complete the form. Providing clear indicators such as placeholders also helps to achieve efficiency.</p>

        <p>Detail is important because it makes filling the form out more intuitive for unfamiliar users. Sizing fields accordingly helps indicate the length of an expected answer.</p>

        <p>This <a href="https://yummygum.com/contact">contact form</a>  by yummygum does a nice job of following best form design practices. They have placeholders for the input fields, clear field titles, and minimal fields to fill out, making the process simple. They also have a nice cursor which gives more visibility on what the user should do.</p>
