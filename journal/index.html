        <p>Although there is more than one way to make great forms, there is still a standard criteria to follow in order to have a high quality form. Forms should be as concise, efficient, and detailed as possible.</p>

        <p>In the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">“Best practices for form design“</a> by Salim Ansari, he highlights great points of what creates a good form. To make forms concise, we have to minimize the input fields, keep a simple layout, and minimize dropdown menus. This reduces the time it takes for respondents to fill out your form, allowing them to stay relaxed and answer your questions clearly.</p>

        <p>To keep your form efficient for your users, you should break down your form strategically. By separating large fields into multiple steps, it is less of a struggle for your users to complete the form. Providing clear indicators such as placeholders also helps to achieve efficiency.</p>

        <p>Detail is important because it makes filling the form out more intuitive for unfamiliar users. Sizing fields accordingly helps indicate the length of an expected answer.</p>

They have placeholders for the input fields, clear field titles, and minimal fields to fill out, making the process simple.
