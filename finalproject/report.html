            <h2>Tasks Tested</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Starting the game</li>
                <li>Filling out answers</li>
                <li>Submitting the answers</li>
                <li>Restarting the game</li>

            <h2>Critiques</h2>

            <h3>Strong Points:</h3>
            <p>The overall balance of the design is cohesive and emits the vibe of the game being referenced (Stardew Valley).</p>
            <p>There is good contrast between the backgrounds and the text.</p>
            <p>The hover states are a good touch to make possible actions for users more obvious.</p>
            <p>Users have the option to go back to different stages of the game.</p>


            <h3>Weak Points:</h3>
            <p>There is no way for the user to backtrack in their actions if were to want to change something.</p>
            <p>The restart button and back button should switch locations for better usability.</p>
            <p>The restart button is only appearing on one overlay but it should be on two of the overlays.</p>
            <p>The start screen's "Stardew Madlibs" button is not as intuitive to press. Consider adding a button or some feature that would make it more obvious to users that it should be pressed.</p>
            <p>There is some space that makes the screen scrollable even though there is no content which could cause confusion to the users.</p>
